 * Binary search AVLtree implementation.
 * 
 * In computer science, a binary search AVLtree (BST), which may sometimes also be
 * called an ordered or sorted binary AVLtree, is a node-based binary AVLtree data
 * structure which has the following properties:
 * 
 * a) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. </br>
 * b) The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. </br>
 * c) Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. </br>
